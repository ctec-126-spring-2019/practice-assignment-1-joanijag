<!--BRUCE!! I can't get the content in the <p> tags to stay formatted. My code auto formates on save but it jacks up what I had written when I try to fix it. I wrote my paragraphs in MS Word and then copied it into plain notepad to clear the formatting, maybe it didn't clear everything and that's what is screwing it up. -->

                    <p class="lead">It's nice to be back in class. I enjoyed PHP last quarter and am excited to dive
                        back into code. I am understanding concepts and am able to work through problems more easily. I
                        have
                        looked forward to earning JavaScript! I am crossing my fingers that a summer internship at Aspen
                        Capital will be approved. I have approval from their Human Resources Department as well as the
                        CTO, who is talking with the
                        dev team to find a project that I can accomplish. The final step is presenting it to the owners
                        of
                        the company for final approval. I’m very hopeful that I will get to have this opportunity. They
                        use
                        Vue.js/Vuetify.js, Node.js Express.js and MongoDB. From what I have heard Vue.js is one of the
                        "lighter-weight" frameworks and is easier for beginners to pick up on. That’s good news as long
                        as I learn everything I can this quarter.</p>

                    <!-- Add an HTML paragraph describing what you want to accomplish in this class. -->
                    <p>I hope to come out of this class with a working knowledge of JavaScript that I can build upon in
                        an
                        internship or
                        on my own, preferably both. I have high expectations of myself and I would like you to also have
                        very high
                        expectations of me as well. If and this is a <strong> Big IF</strong>, depending on how I do
                        with my
                        assignments, would like to begin to build a website for a young photographer friend. I would
                        like to use
                        JavaScript and PHP. The photo gallery in PHP is a terrific start.</p>

                        HTML5 and CSS3 well enough to code basic webpages. I am looking forward to learning JavaScript
